# Python


 * A Python variable is a symbolic name that is a reference or pointer to an object. Once an object is assigned to a variable, you can refer to the object by that name.
 
 * Python has an input function which lets you ask a user for some text input. You call this function to tell the program to stop and wait for the user to key in the data.
